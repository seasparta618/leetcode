# Intersection of 2 Linked Lists Question

Question link: https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/

<span style="font-size: 19px; ">
Some <b>basic thoughts</b> about this question:

1, If 2 list could intersect, they must be both no circular linked list or both circular linked list

2, If 2 none circular linked list could intersect, they must have the same tail

3, If 2 circular linked list could intersect, the intersected node could be out of the shared circle or on the shared circle


This question will not consider the 3rd condition, while the solution to find the intersection for 2 circular linked list will be discusses as well

Basic thinking: some special cases could be detected and directly returned at the beginning:

```java
        if (l1 == null || l2 == null) {
            return null;
        }
        if (l1.next == null && l2.next == null && l1 != l2) {
            return null;
        }
```

For the 2 cases above:

1, 2 null linked lists will be no intersection, 

2, if 2 lists only have one node but are not the same one, will have no intersection as well.

```java
        ListNode f1 = l1;
        ListNode f2 = l2;
        ListNode s1 = l1;
        ListNode s2 = l2;
        int length1 = 1;
        int length2 = 1;
        while (f1.next != null && f1.next.next != null) {
            f1 = f1.next.next;
            s1 = s1.next;
            length1++;
        }
        while (f2.next != null && f2.next.next != null) {
            f2 = f2.next.next;
            s2 = s2.next;
            length2++;
        }
        length1 = f1.next != null ? length1 << 1 : (length1 << 1) - 1;
        length2 = f2.next != null ? length2 << 1 : (length2 << 1) - 1;
        f1 = f1.next == null ? f1 : f1.next;
        f2 = f2.next == null ? f2 : f2.next;
        if (f1 != f2) {
            return null;
        }
```

The next step is to use fast and slow pointer to find the length of the list and get the tail of the list as well

Based on this question, there will be no cycle promised, so both 2 lists should have a last node, which could be called tail.

As mentioned above, if 2 none cycle linked list could intersect, they must have the same tail.

The next part is to shift the long list to the same length of the short list, then iterates together.
```java
        if (length1 > length2) {
            l1 = shift(l1, length1 - length2);
        } else {
            l2 = shift(l2, length2 - length1);
        }
        while (l1 != null) {
            if (l1 == l2) {
                return l1;
            }
            l1 = l1.next;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        return null;
```
